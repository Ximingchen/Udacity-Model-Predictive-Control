# Model Predictive Control Project

---

### Project description and objectives
The goal of this project is to design an MPC-controller to control a vehicle in a virtual environment.
See https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project for the original project repository.


### Pipeline of the project
To achieve the goal of the project, we adopt the following pipeline:

Step 1 - Modeling the vehicle as a bicycle model and analyze the input/output/state/objective function as well as constraint
Step 2 - Tuning parameters in the MPC. More specifically, the parameters include (i) the cost function, (ii) the prediction horizon.

Hereafter, we discuss the above two steps in more details.
